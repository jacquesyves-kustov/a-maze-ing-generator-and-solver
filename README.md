![TestImage](https://i.ibb.co/0MZ8Yj2/TestMaze.jpg)

It uses the [randomized depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_depth-first_search) for creating and [dead-end filling method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze-solving_algorithm#Dead-end_filling) for solving.

## What can I customize?:

- length of a passage
- branching strategy

## How to start?

- Have fun :)
