## Available algorithms:
### - Creating:
The [randomized depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_depth-first_search).
### - Solving:
The [dead-end filling method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze-solving_algorithm#Dead-end_filling).

## What can I customize?: 
- size of a final maze
- length of passages in maze
- branching strategy

## How to start?
- Clone this repo
- Run the code
- Enter size, passage length, etc.
- Have fun :)
